This is an app made with the Angular framework on the front-end and mongoDB and node.js (express) on the back-end. 

Without logging in or registering a new account, the user can search for ads freely. Alternatively,a user can choose to register or to log in if he already has an account and he can post an ad or update/delete one that he posted previously. The user can also sort the categories by price, by different subcategories or by typing in the search box the name of the item that he's looking for. If the user finds that specific item, he can add it to his wishlist to store it for a future date when he wishes to purchase it. Other than that, he can change his name, his password, his thumbnail or his phone number.
